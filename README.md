### Hi there 👋

I've recentently finished Henry Bootcamp as a Full Stack Developer 🚀

I've been working on the final project  " Vitality Medical Group" 
using :

✅ Javascript
</br>
✅ React-Redux
</br>
✅ Node js.
</br>
✅ HTML/ CSS
</br>
✅ Material UI
</br>

I'm interested in learning Power BI, more about CSS and Front End tools to improve.
</br>
</br>
I'm hard working, I love learning new things and specially team work!

🌈 I would love to develop myself in a company 
</br>
where inclusion and genre perspective are taken into account 🌈
